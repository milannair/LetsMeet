# 04-22 Weekly Status Report

## Team Report

### Progress and Issues

We came up with a revised vision and approach for the app. Midway through
working on the requirements document, we realized we weren’t on the same page
regarding how the app worked and how users would be using it. We discussed in
detail our visions for the app and made unanimous decisions on how we would
proceed.

We have listed high-level tasks for completing this project. Each task is
either for a feature of our app or involves setting up infrastructures for app
development and operation, like database and CI environment.

### Plans and Goals

- Make a mock-up of the app’s user interface: everyone
- Create a back-end data model: Leo, Nan, Milan
- Work on the account creation feature: Brandon, Nelson, Apoorva
