### Progress and Issues

The init script was removed accidentally in a merge commit, which prevented a
reviewer from setting up our project, but we were able to add it back to our
repository.

API authentication was added to the back-end. Throughout this process we also
improved the code structure of the API.

Front-end meeting controller is complete.

- Add schedule-related endpoints to user controller in the back-end
- Finish notifications screen and merge pull request #9
- Change default authentication settings in the API
- Work on edit meeting request feature, add new methods
- Work on schedule editing feature
