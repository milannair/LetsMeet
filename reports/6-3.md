### Progress and Issues

We were able to complete most core features of our app and make a demo that
shows the app's major functionality. 

Because many team members have been busy in other classes they are taking, we
did not get enough time to work on small details or make final touches. We plan
to make use of the extended deadline for project artifacts to finalize our
project.

### Plans and Goals for Next Week

- Update existing tests and add more of them
- Update documentation
