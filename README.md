# LetsMeet

LetsMeet is a useful tool for teams and groups to see in what time slots are
their colleagues, family and friends available, and schedule a meeting for a
time period that works for everyone.

## Supported Platforms

LetsMeet's back-end and front-end are both platform-independent. You can run
the back-end on any platform that has Node.js and an internet connection (or Node.js and MongoDB). The
front-end supports Android, iOS and web.
